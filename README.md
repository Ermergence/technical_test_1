# technical_test_1

Hello and welcome !
    This project is using Python 3.9.
    You are free to use any external packages as needed.

    Implement the code needed to answer the following questions and if a value is requested print it into a text file :
    1. Parse the 2 CSV files in the data folder

    2. What is the minimum low value for BTC-USD ?

    3. What is the maximum high value for BTC-USD ?

    4. What is the average close value for ETH-USD ?

    5. What is the close value on 2021-06-03 for BTC-USD ?

    6. What is the 30-days Simple Moving Average value of the close at the close of 2021-04-25 for BTC-USD ?

    7. What is the complexity of your Simple Moving Average algorithm ? Can you make it faster ?

    8. The Simple Moving Average value seems a little bit off. How to make it more coherent ? Implement it.

    9. Resample each CSV data set as weekly candles (opening Monday and closing Sunday). If a candle has to start
    in the middle of the week, you can use the first day as the opening day. And vice versa for closing.
